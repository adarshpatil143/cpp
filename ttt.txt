    --_rating _kw --(indicating charging rating for the unit in kilowatt)

    --_last5_discharged_units  --which could be a vector or array of 5 float values(bothcontainers should be acceptable)
    
    --  _capacity which is a float value.This value must be equal to or more than the combined  of total of _last_5_discharged_units
    if the _capacity is less than the combined value, the object should be invalidated 
     and an exception should be raised.


    -- _cost_per_kw which is a float value  which is indicating the cost 
    the cost for using ChargingUnit for 1 kilo watt battery.
